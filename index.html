        <h1>Lilian's Bookshelf</h1>
        <p>A collection of stories that have stayed with me: some for their characters, others for the questions they dared to ask. Fiction, non-fiction, mystery, memoir… each one here meant something. Take a look, and maybe find your next read.</p>

                    <p class="book-title">The Will of the Many</p>
                    <p>The Will of the Many caught me off guard. I picked it up while still reeling from the latest Way of Kings release, expecting just another dark academia distraction. Instead, I found a world with a power system that felt unsettlingly real—the “will” of the lower classes literally siphoned away, echoing how labor can drain you long after the shift ends.<br>On paper, the setup sounds familiar: the unlikely underdog, not unlike The False Prince or even Red Rising. But the sharp worldbuilding and vivid characters make it feel entirely its own. With book three on the horizon, I’m already ready for a reread.</p>

                    <p class="book-title">Finding Me</p>
                    <p>Viola, Viola, Viola—the world was gifted the day Viola Davis chose to become an actress, and I was lifted through endless workdays listening to her story. Finding Me is her autobiography, but it could just as easily be titled The Story of Any Black Girl Finding Her Way. Even for those who aren’t Black, it speaks to anyone carving an untrodden path—pressing the first indentations into fresh snow with no trail to mimic, bearing the weight of being first. This is a story for anyone bold enough to dream when the world would rather you wake up and live hollow. It’s also a love letter to the small affirmations—the ones from strangers, and from your younger self—when she swears she’ll be a star, an astronaut, whoever she wants to be that day. And, like Viola, you make the choice every day to believe her.</p>

                    <p class="book-title">Wind and Truth</p>
                    <p>This book reminded me of Vinland Saga’s second season—not because “war was over,” but because it asked the same aching question: what does a soldier do when they finally decide to set down their blade? Kaladin, once again the physician’s son, learns what it means to use his hands to mend instead of destroy, even as those around him keep picking up weapons. He begins to build a mental health program for others scarred by war, helping them find peace now that he’s beginning to find his own. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what it would mean for him to come into his full power as a Radiant now that he wasn’t winning through sheer strength—and in awe of how broken people can help piece other broken people together. The series that first hooked me with the words “the most important step you take is not the first one but the next” had me in tears again when Kaladin offered someone living with their mistakes the choice to keep going, to try one more time. And now, with hints that the time and place of this world might not be as distant from ours as we thought, I can’t wait to see where the next arc leads—pick this up at your own peril.</p>
